# Time-Multiplexor-Display
Collaborated in a team to design a time multiplexed circuit to control a 8-digit seven-segment display using Verilog. Simulated a test bench for the completed circuit and synthesized the circuit to a FPGA board using Vivado 2018.2. Presented a professional report using the Nexys Artix-7 FPGA board to demonstrate the time multiplexed display.
